## Provide more context

Inspect element to see additionnal text that will be read by screen savers.

```jsx
<mks-link to="/atoms/mkslink">
  Read more
  <mks-visually-hidden>about penguins in antartica</mks-visually-hidden>
</mks-link>
```

## The opposite of aria-hidden

<code>aria-hidden</code> indicates that an element should be ignored by assistive technologies. 
We can use it in combination with <code>mks-visually-hidden</code> to replace with more suited content.

```jsx
<mks-icon type="search" aria-hidden></mks-icon>
<mks-visually-hidden>Search</mks-visually-hidden>
```
